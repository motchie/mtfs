You can edit MT's template with your favorite text editor, and no needs to use admin screen. \r\n\r\n### Current Status\r\n\r\nCurrent Status of this software is alpha or just a sample.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n- Magnanimous mind.\r\n- Linux (Tested with: CentOS 6.5)\r\n- Root privilege user\r\n- [Movable Type](http://movabletype.org/start/) installed. (Tested with: MOTS 5.2.9 ja)\r\n- [Fuse::Simple] (http://search.cpan.org/~noseynick/Fuse-Simple-1.00/) installed.\r\n\r\n### Test run\r\n\r\n1. Copy mtfs to /path/to/mt/tools\r\n2. `cd /path/to/mt`\r\n3. `sudo perl ./tools/mtfs`\r\n4. Launch another terminal.\r\n5. `sudo ls -lha /mnt/`\r\n6. You'll see a 'templates' directory.\r\n7. `sudo ls -lha /mnt/templates`\r\n8. You'll see many files which filenames are template identifier of your MT.\r\n9. View some files. For example: /mnt/templates/rsd\r\n10. You'll see file contents exactly same as you'll see on MT's admin screen.\r\n11. Press Ctrl+C in terminal which runs mtfs.\r\n12. `sudo umount /mnt` in rest terminal.","google":"UA-46661952-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
